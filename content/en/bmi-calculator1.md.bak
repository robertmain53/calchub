## How to use

Enter your weight in kilograms and height in centimeters to calculate your BMI.

The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure that uses your height and weight to work out if your weight is healthy. The BMI calculation divides an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared.

### BMI Categories:

- Underweight = BMI less than 18.5  
- Normal weight = BMI between 18.5 and 24.9  
- Overweight = BMI between 25 and 29.9  
- Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater
